# Nested_Menu_Project

1. Clone this repo

2. Go to repo: 

```
cd <path to the project directory>
```

3. Create a virtual environment. To do that run the command:

```
python -m venv .venv   # windows
python3 -m venv .venv  # linux or macos
```

:exclamation: If you got the error like "virtualenv : command not found" - that means you don't have the virtualenv package installed. Install it with the command `pip install virtualenv` and go to the start of this step.

4. Then activate your venv:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # windows
source .venv/bin/activate   # linux or macos
```

:exclamation: Make sure that there's a "(.venv)" title at the start of a terminal path line - that means you've succeeded at venv-activation.

5. Install requirements: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Have fun!

:exclamation: Most important part :)
